Description: Contains functions to simulate the most commonly used 
    SAS® procedures.  Specifically, the package aims to 
    simulate the functionality of SAS® 'proc freq', 'proc means',
    'proc transpose', 'proc sort', and 'proc print'. 
    The simulation will include recreating 
    all statistics with the highest fidelity possible.
